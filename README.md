## LORD OF THE OBJECTS PROJECT - **PUB HERO**
Week 2 Project for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp
## Overview
This project is a responsive text Hero adventure game with a unique twist played entirely through the console program of your PC/MAC. The program was designed primarily to show off development of skills in Arrays and Object Oriented Programming as well as a first real program designed via Peer Programming. The program was a collaborative effort between myself and a classmate Link: https://github.com/blueohsix . It utilizes player choices to tell a humorous short story with interactive "combat". Attacks are randomized giving players a chance of defeat with a unique ending.
## Technologies Used
* Development - Java
* IDE - Eclipse
* Text Editor - Atom
* Distributed Version Control - Git/ Github
* Peer Communication - Slack
## Unique Challenges
* Peer development
* Object Oriented Programming
* Arrays
## Lessons Learned
* Utilizing ULM in order to organize and visualize our project before beggining coding.
* Furthering reinforcement of working knowledge on for loops, if, while, switches'.
* First project incorporating Arrays, and Objects Oriented design.
* First major project developed with Peer Programming; developed successful methods of working with peer remotely and in person; utilized version control through git/github; maintained communications through Slack; utilized Pair Programming for local joint programming efficiency.
## Areas of Improvement
* Extended drink options, subtypes for every type of beverage.
* Gender specific storylines
* Random chance of helpful items after finishing a beverage.
