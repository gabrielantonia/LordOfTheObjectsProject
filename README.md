#LORD OF THE OBJECTS PROJECT - **PUB HERO**

##Overview
This project is a proof of the accumulating skill set developing after 2 weeks of the Code Academy Java coding program. It is a responsive text Hero adventure game with a unique twist played entirely through the console program of your PC/MAC. The program was designed primarily to show off development of skills in Arrays and Object Oriented Programming as well as a first real program designed via Peer Programming. The program was a collaborative effort between myself and a classmate Link: https://github.com/blueohsix . I hope you enjoy your time at the pub.

##Technologies Used
* Development - Java
* IDE - Eclipse
* Text Editor - Atom
* Distributed Version Control - Git/ Github
* Peer Communication - Slack

##Unique Challenges
* Peer development
* Object Oriented Programming
* Arrays

##Lessons Learned
* Furthering reinforcement of working knowledge on for loops, if, while, switches'.
* First project incorporating Arrays, and Objects Oriented design.
* First major project developed with Peer Programming; developed successful methods of working with peer remotely and in person; utilized version control through git/github; maintained communications through Slack; utilized Pair Programming for local joint programming efficiency.
