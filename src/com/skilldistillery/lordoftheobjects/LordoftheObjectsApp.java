					{"Bartender: Welcome Mr./Ms. to the Lost Drunkards Tavern! Glad to see you gracing our fine establishment once again. This time I do hope you will make it to the stall before you relieve yourself. \n\n So what will it be for you today? We are having a 3 bottle special tonight, if you can finish 1 bottle of each beer, wine, and liquor your tab is on the house."},
					{"1. Have a bottle of Beer."},
					{"2. Have a bottle of Wine."},
					{"3. Have a bottle of liquor."},
					{"Take a drink"}
				},
				{
					{"You drink some beer. It's hoppy and bitter but you persevere. You try to think happy thoughts of times before your wife left you and took the kids and you lost your house in a fire which unfortunately you could not claim on your insurance due to an unfortunate laps in your payments caused by a changed debit card number that had taken place when you had your wallet stolen the prior week when you were mugged and had your fathers heirloom watch taken which he had kept in un\"holy\" places for the course of several years during his stint in Vietnam in which he lost his mind driving a wedge between him and your mother which led to an early grave for them both.. but at least you have your health."},
					{"The strong scent of hops make you gag but you take another chug. You barely catch your regurgitating contents as they demand release from the confines of your belly. "},
					{"You don't know how much more of this you can handle but you push on. Gulp gulp. A hero such as you is not defeated so easily!"}
				},
				{
					{"The wine is a cheap off brand and you know you will regret it in the morning but you drink it down anyways. Good life choices have never been your forte."},
					{"The color of the wine reminds you of rancid watermelon and it smells like gym socks, you suck it down regardless. You have flashbacks of the many socks that were shoved in your mouth by Tommy Shoback in the 8th grade during P.E.. You remember the unfortunate case of Athletes Foot that spread to your mouth because of this and your first girlfriend Sarah Wilson whom you had had a crush on since the 3rd grade, who left you due to the fungal infection...for Tommy Shoback..Your current Manager."},
					{"Your stomach is turning from the bitter swill but you drink on, continuing to fight your metaphorical windmill with all your might for that glorious prize at the end of the dark tunnel..no bar tab. "			},
				},
				{
					{"Liquor, sweet nectar of the Gods. The Chosen One. The only escape from the humility and mundanity of your pathetic existence. You take your first sip gingerly, a weary yet welcoming embrace to a dear old friend."},
					{"As you drink the bottle you begin to forget all the many mistakes that have led you to this horid little pub. Your thoughts are fading out as your view swims in front of your face."},
					{"You are nearing completion, you are going to get through this, you are going to show Sarah Wilson why she should have chose you and not Tommy Shoback, with his Lamborghini Countach and summer home in the Hamptons. You have something more than he will Tommy Shoback will every have, you have a back story! Tommy Shoback only has 2 references in a silly program written by an amateur Java programmer!"},
				},
				{
					{"Oh no. You blacked out and deffacated all over yourself again! Mrs. Chan at the launder is not gonna be happy about these stains :( ."},
					{"Would you like to try again?"
					},
					{"You did it!!! Congratulations, not only are you going home to night with the same exact amount you had in your wallet coming in here but you are leaving with the pride of knowing that for the first time in as long as you can remember you didn't give up!! You met the challenge in front of you head on and saved the proverbial princess from the metaphorical dragon!! Your treasure is better than riches however,it is even better than life lessons! It is freaking Tommy Shoback's Countach parked across the street at the Marriott! Now you go slash those tires and get some freakin revenge!"
